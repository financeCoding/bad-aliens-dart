Breaking [bad-aliens-dart](https://github.com/sethladd/bad-aliens-dart) by [Seth Ladd](http://profiles.google.com/sethladd) into two parts, the [BadAliensDart](https://github.com/financeCoding/bad-aliens-dart/tree/master/dart-game-engine-2d/sample/BadAliensDart) and [GameEngineLib](https://github.com/financeCoding/bad-aliens-dart/blob/master/dart-game-engine-2d/src/GameEngine/GameEngineLib.dart). The GameEngine is flexable enough to be used as a library in dart for rapid prototyping.
